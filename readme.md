Floating Point Conversion
=========================

This assignment demonstrates converting from a floating point number to an integer using only integer and bitwise operations.

Testing
-------

The included makefile will build the fp.c file and run a series of tests to confirm that a valid implementation has been added to the file. The tests can be run by executing:

```
make
```
